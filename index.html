    <h2>Donate to Our Wish List</h2>
    <p>The families we serve are always in need of the following items. If you can help, please drop off Food or other items between 9am and 4pm Monday to Friday at <b>6 Epworth Ave</b>.</p>
    <p><b>Please do not leave donations at 1475 Caldwell or outside Hidden Gems Boutique. Thanks.</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Healthy Food</b> – for many of our families the Caldwell food bank provides up to 80% of their diet, so we want to make sure that 100% of the food we give is healthy.</li>
    <li><b>Baby Needs</b> –  We are always short of size 5 & 6 diapers, disposable training pants like ‘Pull-Ups’, and wipes (we receive a good supply of diapers size 0 to 4). 
      Sorry we can’t accept car seats or cribs – thank you.</li>
    <li><b>Clothing</b> – We always need good, used (or new) clothing for men, women and children; especially warm clothing for winter, including waterproof mittens and winter boots.  There is also a need for household items, such as dishes, pots and pans, cutlery, sheets and towels for new families moving into the area.</li>
    </ul>
